## Questions & Solutions:

### 1. How would you set up a real-time WebSocket connection in a React component for collaborative editing?

To set up a real-time WebSocket connection in a React component, you need to establish a persistent connection between the client and server. This connection allows for the bi-directional exchange of data. You would typically initialize the WebSocket connection in a React component's lifecycle method or hook, and set up event handlers to manage incoming and outgoing messages. This enables real-time updates and synchronization between users.

### 2. Describe how to implement drawing functionality on an HTML5 canvas using React.

Drawing functionality on an HTML5 canvas using React involves integrating the canvas element within a React component and handling user input to render drawings. You would use the canvas API to handle drawing operations such as lines, shapes, and colors. React's state management can be used to keep track of the drawing state, which is then rendered onto the canvas.

### 3. How can you synchronize the state of the canvas across multiple users in real-time?

To synchronize the state of the canvas across multiple users, you need to use WebSocket or similar real-time communication protocols. When a user makes changes to the canvas, those changes are sent to the server, which then broadcasts the updates to all connected clients. Each client updates its local canvas state based on the received data, ensuring that all users see the same content in real-time.

### 4. Explain how you would handle and display the list of active users.

To handle and display the list of active users, you can maintain a list of connected users on the server. When a user connects or disconnects, the server updates this list and sends the updated list to all clients. On the client side, this information is displayed through a dedicated user interface component, allowing users to see who is currently active in the session.

### 5. What measures would you take to ensure the scalability and performance of the real-time collaborative whiteboard?

To ensure scalability and performance:

* **Optimize WebSocket Connections:** Efficiently manage connections to handle large numbers of users.
* **Load Balancing:** Use load balancers to distribute traffic and prevent bottlenecks.
* **Data Optimization:** Minimize the amount of data sent over the network and use efficient data formats.
* **Performance Monitoring:** Continuously monitor performance and optimize the server and client code based on the observed metrics.
* **Caching and Throttling:** Implement caching strategies and throttle updates to avoid overwhelming the server and clients.
